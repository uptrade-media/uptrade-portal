# MDX Proposals

This directory contains MDX-based proposal files. MDX allows you to write proposals in Markdown with embedded React components for interactive elements.

## How to Create a New Proposal

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `src/proposals/content/`
2. Add frontmatter metadata at the top:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Proposal Title"
client: "Client Name"
date: "January 15, 2025"
proposalId: "unique-slug"
heroVideo: "/path/to/video.mp4"  # optional
heroImage: "/path/to/image.jpg"  # optional
brandColors:
  primary: "#4bbf39"
  secondary: "#39bfb0"
showSignature: true  # optional, adds signature block
---
```

3. Write your proposal content using MDX components (see below)
4. Add the slug to `MDX_PROPOSALS` array in `src/pages/ProposalGate.jsx`
5. Access at `/p/your-slug`

  potential customers who search online before booking.

  <MetricHighlight value="78%" label="Search Before Buying" />

## Tips for Compelling Proposals

1. **Personalization is everything** - Use company name throughout
2. **Lead with pain, sell the dream** - Start with problems, paint success
3. **Make it scannable** - Use visual components, not walls of text
4. **Build to the ask** - Show value BEFORE price
5. **Always include Signal AI** - Tailor benefits to their industry
6. **Create honest urgency** - Limited availability, pricing windows
